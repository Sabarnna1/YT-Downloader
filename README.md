# Youtube Video Downloader
We have made a YouTube Video Downloader that downloads videos from YouTube by taking the URL link from the user
- We have mainly used **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** (for Frontend) and **Node.js**, **Express.js** (for Backend)
- We used the inbuilt **ytdl-core npm package** which helps in downloading the YouTube video
### Additional Features
- Before Downloading, it shows the entire **video name**, **video description** along with its **thumbnail**
- The user can filter from the various available **MP4 formats** from a dropdown list and accordingly choose the quality of video the user wants to **download** (*Qualities vary from 360p to 480p to 720p depending on the avaible video quality*)
