# Youtube Video Download
We have made a YouTube Video Downloader that downloads videos from YouTube by taking the URL link from the user
- We mainly used **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** (for Frontend) and used **Node.js**, **Express.js** (for Backend)
- We used the inbuilt **ytdl-core npm package** which helps in downloading the YouTube video
### Additional Features
- Before Downloading, it shows the entire **video name**, **video description** along with its **thumbnail**
- The user can filter from the various available **MP4 formats** from a dropdown list and accordingly choose the quality of video the person wants to **download**
*** which mainly includes 360p and 720p.
### NOTE
*You can refer to the source code of **ytdl-core** along with all the features that it provides [**here**](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core)*
